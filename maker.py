        There are two type of order you can make each time interval: market order and limit order.

        Market order: an order to buy or sell a stock at the current market price. The buy and sell price
        is determined by the market (not you). Market order doesn't have a time frame. If you are setting the
        next bid price and next ask price for a market order, it will be defaulted to the market bid and ask price.

        Limit order: an order to buy or sell a stock at a specific price or better. 
        A buy limit order can only be executed at the limit price or lower (compare to market ask/sell price), 
        and a sell limit order can only be executed at the limit price or higher (compare to market bid/buy price). 
        Limit order have a time frame, from_time and to_time, which specifies the time interval in which the
        order is valid.

        Market order have higher priority than limit order. If you are setting both market order and limit order
        in a given time interval, the market order will be executed first.

            To return a market order, you can use OrderType.new_market_order(timestamp)

            Note that the volume to buy and sell can be any integer value, including 0. If the volume is negative,
            it will be set to 0. If the volume to sell is more than the holding, it will be set to the holding.
